split.cpp: This file contains code that recursively splits the elements of a sorted (in increasing order), singly-linked list of integers into two singly-linked lists,
one for even numbers and one for odd numbers. 

ulliststr.cpp: This file contains the implementation of an unrolled linked list, a doubly-linked list that stores an array of values rather than a single data value. It
provides functions to push_back, push_front, pop_back, and pop_front.
